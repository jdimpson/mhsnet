     These files provide an optional parameter changing facility.
     The  network  is  configured with the defaults listed below,
     but any of these defaults can  be  changed  by  editing  the
     relevant parameter file to set the new value.

     The basic parameter file that affects all  network  programs
     is `/usr/lib/MHSnetparams'.  It is installed in a _w_e_l_l-_k_n_o_w_n
     location principally because it allows the network operating
     directory  to  be  altered.   The  other parameter files are
     named after the programs whose operations they  affect,  and
     are  found  in  the directory `SPOOLDIR/_params'.  Note that
     only parameters specific to  `/usr/lib/MHSnetparams'  should
     be  placed  there,  others should be set in their respective
     program-specific files as described below.

     The program _n_e_t_p_a_r_a_m_s(8) displays  the  default  or  altered
     parameter settings.

     Some  parameters  represent  arguments  passed  to  programs
     called  by  the  network  message  handlers.  There are some
     macros that can be  used  inside  arguments  to  interpolate
     fields from the message being processed by the handler, they
     are all identified by the special character &&&&:

     &&&&DDDD   _D_a_t_a _n_a_m_e.****  The name of the data in the message.

     &&&&EEEE   _E_r_r_o_r.       The  value  of  the  error  field  in  the
                       message header.

     &&&&FFFF   _F_r_o_m.****       The name of the sender of the message.

     &&&&HHHH   _H_o_m_e.        The name of the destination host (on which
                       the program is being invoked).

     &&&&LLLL   _L_i_n_k.        The name of the link on which the  message
                       arrived.

     &&&&OOOO   _O_r_i_g_i_n.      The  name  of  the  host  from  which  the
                       message originated.

     &&&&SSSS   _S_i_z_e.        The size of the data in the message.

     &&&&TTTT   _S_t_a_r_t _t_i_m_e.  The time that  the  message  was  inserted

                       into the network at its origin (GMT).

     &&&&UUUU   _U_s_e_r.****       The name of the user to which the  message
                       is being delivered.

     &&&&&&&&                The way to escape an &&&&.

     &&&&%%%%                The way to escape a %%%% (see below).

     Those marked with an asterisk are only  valid  for  messages
     containing   FTP.    [Messages   containing  `File  Transfer
     Protocol' are generated by _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1).]

     There is a set of macros related to the above  that  can  be
     used  to  interpolate  a string depending on the presence of
     absence of a value associated with the `&&&&' macro of the same
     name.   If  the  string  is  not  interpolated  the macro is
     replaced by the null string, and if this causes  the  entire
     argument  to  become  empty  it  is omitted from the list of
     arguments.  These macros are all  enclosed  by  the  special
     character %%%%, and take the form:

          %%%%{++++|----}XXXX_s_t_r_i_n_g%%%%

     The _s_t_r_i_n_g is interpolated if the form ++++XXXX is  used  and  the
     `&&&&'  macro would yield a non-empty string, or if the form ----XXXX
     is used and the `&&&&' macro would yield an empty string. Eg:

          %+Llink%

     will interpolate `link' if the macro &&&&LLLL would yield  a  non-
     empty link name.

     There  is  another  set  of  macros  that  can  be  used  to
     interpolate a string depending on the evaluation of a simple
     boolean expression.  If the string is not  interpolated  the
     macro is replaced by the null string, and if this causes the
     entire argument to become empty it is omitted from the  list
     of  arguments.  These macros are all enclosed by the special
     character %%%%, and take the form:

          %%%%[!!!!]XXXX_s_t_r_i_n_g%%%%

     If the condition selected by XXXX evaluates  to  ttttrrrruuuueeee  and  the
     optional !!!! was not given then _s_t_r_i_n_g is interpolated.  Where
     the !!!! is given _s_t_r_i_n_g is  interpolated  when  the  condition
     evaluates   to  ffffaaaallllsssseeee.   The  _s_t_r_i_n_g  given  may  contain  &&&&
     substitutions,  however  nested  %%%%  substitutions  are   not
     permitted.

     Parameters are  defined  the  same  way  one  defines  shell
     variables, as in: NAME=value, one per line.  There are three
     sorts  of  parameters,  strings,  arrays  of  strings,   and
     numbers.   String  arrays  are  merely comma (`,') separated
     strings, as in: MAILERARGS="-A","-B".  Spaces or tabs around
     the  `===='  will be ignored, as will trailing spaces and tabs.
     Strings may be enclosed  in  double-quotes,  which  will  be
     ignored.   Double-quotes  may  be  escaped  with a backslash
     (`\').  Commas within quoted strings are  ignored.   Numbers
     are  hexadecimal  if they have a leading `0x', octal if they
     have a leading `0', otherwise decimal.

     Comments may be introduced with a hash  character  (`#')  at
     the  start  of  a line, and continue to the end of the line.
     Empty lines are ignored.

     The  parameters  NCC_MANAGER  and  NCC_ADMIN  which  contain
     network addresses may contain several addresses separated by
     spaces.

         `/bin/mail'  should  always  work,  as  the network will

         If you have a version of  mail  that  understands  about
         interpolating  the origin host address in the mail item,
         then this is where you tell it what to do.  For example,
         a   particular   mail   program  may  use  the  argument
         `----nnnn_u_s_e_r@@@@_h_o_s_t' to tell mail that  we  wish  the  item  to
         appear  to come from someone other than the invoker; ie:
         we set BINMAILARGS to be "-n&F@&O".

         The default parameters  to  be  used  by  the  transport
         daemons if the connection fails to negotiate properly.

     FILESERVERLOG
         The name for an optional file which will be used to  log
         fileserver requests.

     FILESERVER_MAXC
         The maximum  number  of  columns  allowed  when  listing
         pathnames.   If  a  path name is longer than this, it is
         truncated at the front with the truncated part  replaced
         by elipses.  [No truncation if 0000.]

     FILESERVER_MAXL
         The maximum size of a fileserver  listing  request  that
         will  be  returned.  Long listings are truncated to this
         length.  [No truncation if 0000.]  (It is suggested that  a
         pre-prepared  recursive directory listing be placed in a
         file  named  `ls-lRt.Z'  to  make  it  unnecessary   for
         requesters to do recursive verbose listings.)

     FILESERVER_NOLR
         Setting this parameter to 1111 disables  recursive  listing
         requests to the fileserver.

     FILESERVER_NOX
         Setting this parameter to  1111  disables  `in-place'  file
         transmission  by the fileserver.  Instead copies will be
         made of each file requested.  This is  useful  if  files
         are   being  serviced  that  change  frequently,  as  it
         prevents the use of the ----XXXX flag to _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1), which can
         cause the transport daemons to complain if an `in-place'
         file changes size  between  being  requested  and  being
         transmitted.

         After files have been spooled at a site for delivery  to
         a  local  user,  the  user  is notified by mail that the
         files have arrived, and warned that  the  spooled  files
         will be deleted after a certain number of days.  This is
         where you specify that period.   It  is  effected  by  a
         periodic command run by _n_e_t_i_n_i_t .

     FILTERPROG
         Defines the name of the program to be run by  a  message
         _f_i_l_t_e_r  to process the data from a message, defaults to:
         `filtername.sh', where _f_i_l_t_e_r_n_a_m_e is the name the filter
         was invoked with.

     FOREIGNUSERNAME
         Defines the user id that will own files  passed  to  the
         foreign network interface, defaults to: NETUSERNAME.

     GETFILE
         The name of the program used by a user to get files they
         have been sent.

     HANDLERPROG
         Defines the name of the program to be run by  a  message
         _h_a_n_d_l_e_r to process the data from a message, defaults to:
         `handlername.sh', where  _h_a_n_d_l_e_r_n_a_m_e  is  the  name  the
         handler was invoked with.

     IGN_ETCPASSWD
         Setting this to 1111 causes  _n_e_t_s_h_e_l_l  (_8)  to  ignore  any
         entry in the `/etc/passwd' file and force a check of the
         network region password for a matching site (if set).

     IGNMAILERSTATUS
         This parameter refers to the exit status of the  program
         defined   in  MAILER  below.   Some  delivery  programs,
         notably  `sendmail'  from  4BSD,  return  non-zero  exit
         status, even when they have done something sensible with
         the mail item.  In this case, the handler would normally
         assume  that  something  went wrong, and return the mail
         item to its origin with an  appropriate  error  message,
         but  you  can suppress this action by defining this flag
         to be 1111.  If the  mailer  returns  the  exit  status  67
         [EX_NOUSER]  as  well  as  sending  a separate reply for
         non-existent user errors, then set this flag to  2222,  and
         only that error status will be ignored.

     KEEPSTATE
         This  parameter  controls  the  building  of  the   site
         information data-base used for quick reference by _n_e_t_m_a_p
         (_1) when showing the details for a particular site.   It
         causes the last state message received from each site to
         be   saved   in   a   directory   tree    starting    at

         `SPOOLDIR/_state/MSGS'.  Set it to 0000 to prevent saving.

     LOCALSEND
         Set this to 1 if you wish to allow users  whose  network
         SEND  permission  has been denied in the `netprivs' file
         (see _n_e_t_p_r_i_v_s (_5)) to be able to use the network to send
         messages to other users on the same node.

     LOCAL_NODES
         This is a more extensive version of LOCALSEND,  in  that
         you can nominate a set of nodes to which messages may be
         sent by users otherwise denied network SEND  permission.
         It  can  either  be  a list of network addresses, or the
         name of a file containing the list.  The  addresses  can
         be separated by <tab> or <newline>.

     LOGFILE
         If a message filtering  program  defined  in  FILTERPROG
         doesn't  exist,  or  is unexecutable, then _n_e_t_f_i_l_t_e_r (_8)
         defaults to logging information about the message in the
         file  defined  by  this parameter.  If this parameter is
         undefined, it defaults to  `_stats/_l_i_n_k._f_l_t_r._l_o_g'  _w_h_e_r_e
         _l_i_n_k is the name of the link the filter is invoked for.

     MAILER
         This defines a program that will be used to deliver mail
         received off the network, ie: from users at other hosts.
         It must behave in the same way  as  BINMAIL  above,  and
         again,  `/bin/mail' should always work.  However, if you
         have a special program used just  for  _d_e_l_i_v_e_r_i_n_g  mail,
         then this is the place to specify it.

     MAILERARGS
         If MAILER can be told where the mail originated, then it
         should  be  specified in this argument, much the same as
         for BINMAILARGS above.  Please note  that  this  is  the
         only  safe  way  to guarantee that mail `From' lines are
         valid.  MAILER should interpolate this string  in  place
         of any user/site addresses in the body of the mail item.

     MAIL_FROM
         If your version of MAILER does not  correct  the  `From'
         line using the information from MAILERARGS, then setting
         this to 1111 will enable the mail handler itself to  add  a
         standard UNIX mail header.

     MAIL_RFC822_HDR
         Setting this to 1111 causes internally  generated  mail  to
         include an RFC822 compliant mail header.

     MAIL_TO
         Setting this to 1111 causes internally  generated  mail  to

         include a `To: ' header line.

     MAX_MESG_DATA
         This is the maximum message size that  is  sent  through
         the  network.  Messages larger than this are broken into
         MAX_MESG_DATA sized parts and sent independently through
         the network and reassembled before delivery.

     MESSAGEID
         Set this to 1111 to cause _n_e_t_m_a_i_l (_1) to generate an RFC822
         compliant `Message-ID: ' line in every header.

     MINSPOOLFSFREE
         This is the minimum amount of free space desired on  the
         network spool file-system (in kilobytes).  When the free
         space falls below this, the  message  creating  programs
         will either wait for more space to become available (eg:
         the transport daemon receiver process  -  see  _n_e_t_d_a_e_m_o_n
         (_8)), or return error codes (eg: _n_e_t_f_i_l_e (_1)).

     MKDIR
         The command for making a directory.

     NCC_ADMIN
         This defines the name of  the  person  to  whom  network
         generated error reports are sent.  By preference a local
         network wizard, maybe `Postmaster', or possibly  `root',
         alternatively  it  may be the network address of someone
         central  who  fixes  problems  in  your  branch  of  the
         network.   This  is  most  useful  when you have a large
         network with central control.

     NCC_MANAGER
         In contrast to NCC_ADMIN, this defines the name  of  the
         person to whom network generated information reports are
         sent.  Usually the same as NCC_ADMIN,  alternatively  it
         may  be  the  network  address  of  someone  central who
         collects information on your branch of the network.

     NETADMIN
         Set to 1111 to cause mail notices of new regions  added  to
         routing  tables  to be sent to NCC_MANAGER.  Also causes
         notification of new/deceased links  to  your  site,  and
         turns      on     state     broadcast     logging     in
         `SPOOLDIR/_state/log'.  Set it to 2222  if  you  want  mail
         notices  every  time  a  new  site sends its first state
         message, or a calling site has problems.  Set it to 3333 if
         you  want  mail  notices every time a link changes state
         (up/down).

     NETGROUPNAME
         The group id used by network processes.

     NETUSERNAME
         The user id used by network processes.

     NEWSARGS
         Any arguments for NEWSEDITOR.

     NEWSCMDS
         This should be the name of a file which is used  by  the
         news  message  handler  _r_e_p_o_r_t_e_r  to  provide  the  full
         pathname of a news  command  and  any  extra  arguments.
         This   can   safely   be  ignored  until  you  become  a
         sophisticated news gatherer.  The  file  should  contain
         lines of the form:
           command<tab>full_path_name[<space>arg ...]
         You  should  consult  with  your  news   neighbours   to
         determine  the  necessary  commands  to install here (if
         any).

     NEWSEDITOR
         If you participate in the _n_e_t_n_e_w_s system, this  argument
         specifies the news receiver program to be invoked by the
         news message handler _r_e_p_o_r_t_e_r .

     NEWSIGNERR
         Some versions of _r_n_e_w_s return non-zero exit status  when
         they  receive a null news item.  If these are a frequent
         occurrence, or you simply wish to  ignore  all  delivery
         errors  for  news items, then you can suppress the error
         reports by defining this flag to be 1111.  It is probably a
         good  idea  to  leave the value at 0000 (the default) until
         you are sure that normal news items are being  delivered
         correctly.

     NICEDAEMON
         If you wish the transport  daemons  to  run  at  a  non-
         standard priority, then this parameter should be defined
         as for use in the _n_i_c_e(2) system call.  For instance, if
         you  wanted  the network to run only when there was idle
         CPU time, then give it the value 19.  However, be  aware
         that  if  you  do this when the system is busy, then the
         links may appear to go up and down a lot.  Using a value
         of  -5  will ensure the transport daemons always achieve
         high throughput, which is acceptable since they are  not
         very CPU intensive.  A value of 0 is probably safe.

     NICEHANDLERS
         When a message arrives, and is  passed  to  the  routing
         program  to  be processed, this parameter will cause the
         handlers to be run at  a  different  priority  from  the
         daemon.   We  use a value of 10, which is nice to users.
         This parameter may also be specified  on  a  per-handler
         basis  by altering the appropriate field in the _h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s



SunOS 5.6            Last change: MHSnet 1.3                   10

         file  (see  _n_e_t_h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s(5).)   Note  that   the   router
         processes   messages   serially,   so   slowing  down  a
         particular  handler  will  also  delay   any   following
         messages  (but  see  _n_e_t_h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s(5) for a way to specify
         asynchronous _s_u_b-routers for particular handlers).

     NOADDRCOMPL
         Set to 0000 to allow address completion.   Without  address
         completion,  every network address must have all domains
         present, up to and including the  COUNTRY-level  domain,
         or  be  fully  typed.  If address completion is allowed,
         then addresses ending in any untyped domain that matches
         one in the local hierachy will have the remainder of the
         hierarchy appended.  This may not be a good idea if  any
         domain  in  the  hierarchy  happens  to be the same as a
         valid COUNTRY code,  or  other  domain  in  the  routing
         tables.

     NODENAMEFILE
         If your UNIX kernel is a variant of  neither  SYSTEM  V,
         nor  BSD4.x,  then this parameter names a file where the
         name of your  node  is  kept.   This  name  is  used  in
         displaying  which nodes in a distributed file system the
         various network daemons are running on.  This is  needed
         since the network name of the collection of nodes in all
         probability will be different.

     NORET
         Setting this to 1111 will cause _n_e_t_m_a_i_l to request that all
         delivery   errors   be  ignored  for  mail  messages  it
         generates.

     NVETIMECHANGE
         The maximum negative system  time  change  (in  seconds)
         tolerated   by   time  sensitive  daemons  [default:  10
         seconds].

     NVETIMEDELAY
         The time in seconds that _n_e_t_i_n_i_t (_8)  will  delay  after
         detecting  a  negative  system  time change greater than
         NVETIMECHANGE  before  re-starting   network   processes
         [default: 600 - 10 minutes].

     PORT
         The port number used by MHSnet TCP/IP connections.

     POSTMASTER
         This must be set to be a  name  that  messages  returned
         from your node may legally be sent to in the case of the
         origin  also  returning  them.   If  your  mail  program
         doesn't  recognise  anything special such as POSTMASTER,
         then this must be the name  of  a  real  user  [default:

         root].   International  networking  conventions  require
         that `postmaster' be a valid mail address on your system
         as  a  way to guarantee deliveries of enquiries and mail
         problem reports, so the mail message handler  intercepts
         any  case  of `postmaster' and interpolates the value of
         this parameter.

     POSTMASTERNAME
         Set to a string to be used in mail `From' lines in  mail
         internally generated by MHSnet [default: Postmaster].

     PRINTER
         The name of the program used to spool  print  jobs  from
         the  network.   Leave  it  undefined if this host has no
         printer, or if you have no intention  of  letting  other
         sites  print  their  jobs  here.   (But see PRINTORIGINS
         below.)

     PRINTERARGS
         Any arguments for PRINTER.

     PRINTORIGINS
         If you ddddoooo define PRINTER, then you will need to restrict
         the  sites  from  which you are prepared to accept print
         jobs.  This parameter can be either the path name  of  a
         file  containing  a  list  of  legal network origins for
         print jobs, or just a  list  of  sites  specified  as  a
         multicast address.

     PRIVSFILE
         The name of a file where network users' privileges  will
         be listed (see _n_e_t_p_r_i_v_s(5)).

     PUBLICFILES
         Defines the directory (or  name  of  a  file  containing
         directories) where publicly accessible files are held.

     RECEIVED
         Setting this to 1111 will  cause  _n_e_t_m_a_i_l  to  generate  an
         RFC822 compliant `Received: ' line in every mail header.

     RECEIVER
         Defines the name of the program to be run by  a  message
         _s_p_o_o_l_e_r to process the data from a message, defaults to:
         `spoolername.sh', where  _s_p_o_o_l_e_r_n_a_m_e  is  the  name  the
         spooler was invoked with.

     RMDIR
         The command for removing a directory.

     SENDACKARGS
         Defines the args to be passed to SENDER to send  a  mail

         message with an acknowledgment request.

     SENDARGS
         Defines the args to be passed to SENDER to send  a  mail
         message.

     SENDER
         Defines the name of the program to send a  network  mail
         message.

     SERVER
         The name of the program used to  receive  MHSnet  TCP/IP
         connections.

     SERVERGROUP
         The group name to run the file service under.

     SERVERUSER
         The user name to run the file service under.

     SERVICE
         The name of  the  `service'  used  when  establishing  a
         MHSnet TCP/IP connection.

     SHELL
         The name of  the  command  interpreter  to  be  used  by
         network `shell' scripts.

     SHOW_ROUTE
         Set this flag to 1111 to show the message route  by  adding
         _R_e_c_e_i_v_e_d: lines to mail headers.

     SPOOLDIR
         This should be the name of a  directory  where  all  the
         network  activity  will take place.  It will contain all
         the messages that are _i_n _f_l_i_g_h_t as well as  the  handler
         programs   and   network  state  files.   It  should  be
         somewhere safe, where the integrity of the  messages  is
         least  likely  to be compromised, (so try and avoid less

         would be: `/usr/spool/MHSnet'.

         containing SPOOLDIR must also be changed.

     STATE
         The pathname of the `netstate' command.

     STATERNOTLIST
         This parameter allows you to nominate  a  set  of  nodes
         whose state messages will be ignored if they arrive more
         frequently than once an hour.  It can either be  a  list
         of  network  addresses, or the name of a file containing

         the list. eg:
         STATERNOTLIST=*.su.oz.au
         The addresses in `ignorelist' can be separated by  <tab>
         or <newline>.

     STOP
         The pathname of the `netstop' command.

     STTY
         The pathname of the `stty' command.

     SUN3
         Set this to 1 if you wish the `.au' to be stripped  from
         the  end  of  mail  addresses  ending  in  `.oz.au' (for
         backward   compatibility   with   sites   running    the
         software).

     TMPDIR
         The pathname of  the  directory  to  use  for  temporary
         files.

     TRACEFLAG
         Turns on program tracing at a level between 1111 and 9999.

     ULIMIT
         The  size  of  the  `ulimit'  value  used   by   network
         processes.

     UUCPLCKDIR
         The name of the directory where `uucp' creates its  lock
         files.

     UUCPLCKPRE
         The prefix for `uucp' lock file names, normally `LCK..',
         which is followed by the device name.

     UUCPLOCKS
         Set this to 1111 to  turn  on  `uucp'  locking  for  device
         access.

     UUCPLOWERDEV
         Set this to 1111 if `uucp' lock files must  have  the  last
         char  of  the `tty' name forced to lower-case, common in
         SCO versions where `tty' names have an  upper-case  char
         to  indicate  dial-out  copy  of a modem line, (default:
         copy of `tty' name in `/dev').

     UUCPMLOCKDEV
         Set this to 1111 if `uucp' lock files are named  after  the
         major/minor  device  numbers, rather than the `tty' name
         in `/dev', (default: copy of `tty' name in `/dev').

     UUCPSTRPID
         Set this to 1111 if `uucp' lock files contain  the  locking
         process ID in ASCII, (default: binary integer).

     VALIDATEMAIL
         Some mail delivery programs are guaranteed to fail (dump
         a  _c_o_r_e  file,  or  write  a  _d_e_a_d._l_e_t_t_e_r  file)  if the
         destination  user  doesn't  exist,  in  which  case  the
         handler  might  as well check first that the user exists
         in the password file.   You  can  force  this  check  to
         happen by defining this flag to be 1111.

     VCDAEMON
         The name of the default virtual circuit daemon.

     WHOISARGS
         Any additional arguments  you  might  want  to  pass  to
         WHOISPROG.

     WHOISFILE
         The name of the people data-base.  It should contain all
         the information about your users that is deemed publicly
         accessible.  A carefully pruned  copy  of  `/etc/passwd'
         would  do, but you should convert all capitals to lower-
         case, unless your version of WHOISPROG  has  an  `ignore
         case'  flag,  (in  which  case  turn  it on in WHOISARGS
         above).   For  example,  you  could  use  the  following
         command  (perhaps  run once a month by _c_r_o_n) to make the
         pruned _w_h_o_i_s file:
           cut -d: -f1,5 /etc/passwd |
           tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' >/usr/pub/whois

     _W_H_O_I_S_P_R_O_G
         The name of the program which will attempt to match  the
         supplied  pattern  in  the  _w_h_o_i_s data-base.  It will be
         passed arguments as for _e_g_r_e_p(1), which is  the  obvious
         candidate.

EEEEXXXXAAAAMMMMPPPPLLLLEEEE
     The file `/usr/lib/MHSnetparams' might contain:

       BINMAIL=/usr/lib/delivermail
       BINMAILARGS="%B-b%","%+L-l%","&L","&F@&O"
       NCC_MANAGER="postmaster fred@mhs.oz.au"
       NETADMIN=2
       SPOOLDIR=/var/local/spool/net

SSSSEEEEEEEE AAAALLLLSSSSOOOO
     _n_e_t_w_o_r_k(7), _n_e_t_p_a_r_a_m_s(8).

.SH NAME
netrq \- fetch remote network queue details
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI \*(S6
.RB [\-[ a ][ q ]]
.IR address " ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(S2
requests details of messages to/from the invoker at remote sites matched by
.IR address .
\*(S2
is a shell script that invokes
.IR netmsg (8)
to pass a request to the queue interrogation message handler,
which invokes
.IR netq (1)
to satisfy the request.
The results are returned as mail to the invoker.
.PP
The optional flags modify this behaviour:
.if n .ds tw 4
.if t .ds tw \w'\fB\-X\fPX'u
.TP "\*(tw"
.BI \-a
Requests details about all messages on all queues.
.TP
.BI \-q
Requests the \s-1ID\s0 for the message,
which is written to
.IR stdout .
.TP
.BI \-?
Explain argument options and exit.
.PP
Note that only network `super-users'
(as indicated by the flag
.SM SU
shown by
.IR netprivs (1))
are able to use the flag \fB\-a\fP,
which will cause the results to be returned to the special user `network'.
If this user doesn't have a normal mailbox,
then you should arrange for mail to be forwarded with
.IR netforward (1).
.PP
Requests generated by \*(S3 are served by the handler
.if n `qlooker'.
.if t \f(CWqlooker\fP.

     _N_e_t_g_e_t will retrieve files spooled from the network  in  the
     spool  area  (as reported by _m_a_i_l(1)).  _N_e_t_g_e_t finds all the
     files spooled for the invoker,  prints  out  the  number  of
     files  found,  sorts  them  into _m_o_d_i_f_y _t_i_m_e order, and then
     prompts for each file for  the  invoker  to  decide  on  the
     action  to  be  taken,  (reply  `append',  `basename', `cd',
     `delete', `keep', `mkdir', `no' [default], `quit',  `rename'
     or  `yes'  as appropriate - the first letter is sufficient).
     The _y_e_s action is to  copy  the  file  into  the  path  name
     indicated,  and  delete  the  spooled copy.  If the reply is
     `cd', `mkdir' or `rename' and no path name is supplied after
     the command, then _n_e_t_g_e_t will prompt you for a new pathname.
     The _k_e_e_p command effect is the same as for _y_e_s, but the file
     will  not  be  deleted after copying (can be default for all
     files with the ----kkkk flag below).

     Any filename arguments will restrict the selection to  those
     named.

     _N_e_t_g_e_t'_s action may be modified by the following flags:

     ----ddddeeeelllleeeetttteeee
         Delete all (named) files.

     ----1111  Only get the first  file  with  the  same  name  as  the
         argument.

     ----aaaa  Search for all files, rather than just  those  belonging
         to  the invoker.  The name of the recipient will also be
         printed.   The  default  sort  order  is  on   name   of
         recipient.   This  flag  is  restricted  to  the network
         _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r .

     ----bbbb  Truncate all file pathnames  to  their  last  component.
         (cf: "basename" command above.)

     ----cccc  Do a check  of  the  CRC  on  the  data  if  it  exists.
         (Generated  by  the  ----cccc  flag  to _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1) and checked
         automatically by the file handler on reception.)

     ----dddd  Create directories  as  needed  to  match  pathnames  of
         retrieved files.

     ----eeee  Files will be sorted by  delivery  time.   The  delivery
         time  of  the  message  will  be  printed instead of the

         modify  time  of  the  file,  unless  _v_e_r_b_o_s_e  mode   is
         selected, in which case both will be printed.

     ----ffff  Set, or unset,  file  forwarding  for  the  invoker.   A
         second  argument  should be supplied which is an address
         for files  to  be  forwarded  to.   A  missing  argument
         implies  that forwarding should be turned off.  See also
         _n_e_t_f_o_r_w_a_r_d(1).

     ----kkkk  Keep all files - don't delete any files  retrieved  from
         messages.  This causes the _d_e_l_e_t_e command to be ignored.
         Individual files may also be  retained  after  retrieval
         (cf: the _k_e_e_p command above).

     ----llll  The (named) files will be listed only.

     ----mmmm  Files will be sorted by modify time [default].

     ----nnnn  Files will be sorted by name.

     ----oooo  The named files will be copied to _s_t_d_o_u_t.  They will not
         then be deleted unless the flag -_d_e_l_e_t_e is used.

     ----rrrr  The order of the sort will be reversed.

     ----ssss  Do it silently.

     ----tttt  Files will be sorted by  transmit  time.   The  transmit
         time  of  the  message  will  be  printed instead of the
         modify  time  of  the  file,  unless  _v_e_r_b_o_s_e  mode   is
         selected, in which case both will be printed.

     ----uuuu  Don't set the modify date for the retrieved file back to
         the original for the transmitted file.

     ----vvvv  Give a verbose description of each file, including  full
         destination address, and route taken.  The delivery time
         for the message will also be printed before  the  modify
         time for the file.

     ----xxxx  Just report the number of (named) files spooled  (unless
         the  flag  ----ssss  is elected), and return the number as the
         exit status (max. 127).

     ----yyyy  Assume answer `yes' to all questions.

     ----FFFF _s_o_u_r_c_e
         Only consider messages sent from the site _s_o_u_r_c_e.

     ----OOOO _d_a_y_s
         Only consider messages older than _d_a_y_s.

     ----SSSS _s_e_n_d_e_r
         Only consider messages sent by the person _s_e_n_d_e_r.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----UUUU _n_a_m_e
         The name of the user whose files are to be retrieved  is
         changed  to _n_a_m_e.  This flag is restricted to the _s_u_p_e_r-
         _u_s_e_r.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     Either one of ----FFFF or ----SSSS (but not both) may be specified as in
     ----FFFF_s_e_n_d_e_r@@@@_s_o_u_r_c_e....

     _N_e_t_g_e_t will create the files with the mode of  the  original
     as modified by your file creation mask (see _u_m_a_s_k(1)).

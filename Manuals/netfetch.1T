     _N_e_t_f_e_t_c_h  will  obtain   files   from   publicly   available
     directories on consenting hosts.

     Filenames should not be absolute path names (a leading slash
     will be ignored) - they will be interpreted relative to some
     appropriate directory on the  remote  host.   The  directory
     used  might  depend upon the host that you issue the request
     from, or your login name, or both.

     Files are returned by the remote server executing _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1)
     with appropriate arguments.

     There is a (small) upper limit on the number of  files  that
     may  be  retrieved  in  any  one  execution  of the _n_e_t_f_e_t_c_h
     command.  Requests for more than this number of  files  will
     return the allowed number of files, and a message indicating
     that the limit was exceeded.  The limit can be  expected  to
     be in the mid twenties.

     The mandatory _f_r_o_m_h_o_s_t  argument  specifies  the  host  that
     files are to be obtained from.

     Please note that wildcard symbols in the filename part  will
     not be expanded.

     _N_e_t_f_e_t_c_h's action may be modified by the following flags:

     ----cccc  Request that a CRC be applied to files returned from the
         remote host.

     ----eeee  Don't return message if errors are detected in request.

     ----llll  Instead of returning the files named,  return  names  of
         those  files  that  are  available.  This can be used to
         discover which files exist at  a  remote  host,  without
         actually  retrieving  them.   With  this  flag, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
         arguments may also be directory names.  Note that in the
         returned  list,  overlong  filenames  will  have leading
         ellipses.

     ----qqqq  Report the request ID on _s_t_d_o_u_t and include  it  in  any
         response  that is returned.  This allows the matching of
         requests with responses.

     ----mmmm  Don't signal reception of requested files via mail.

     ----rrrr  With  ----llll  causes  the  search  to  recurse  through  any
         directories encountered.

     ----vvvv  With ----llll returns more data, including  last  modification
         time and size.

     ----SSSS _s_e_n_d_e_r
         Change the name of  the  originator  to  _s_e_n_d_e_r.   (This
         option is restricted to network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r_s.)

     ----TTTT_n Activate tracing at level _n.  If tracing is not compiled
         in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     Obtain the file _f_o_o from  the  public  directory  at  Sydney
     University's Computer Science Department.

       netfetch cs.su.oz.au foo

     Obtain a listing of the  public  file  directory  ````....''''   from
     Melbourne University's Computer Science Department.

       netfetch -lv cs.mu.oz.au .

     This is the  starting  point  to  determine  what  might  be
     available at some site.

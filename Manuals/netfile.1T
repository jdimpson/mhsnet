     _N_e_t_f_i_l_e inserts messages containing files into  the  network
     to be transmitted to users at remote destinations.

     Both _u_s_e_r_s and _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_s may be  comma  separated  lists,
     together they are known as an _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.  An _a_d_d_r_e_s_s binds the
     _u_s_e_r_s to the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_s and causes the network to generate
     the minimal number of message copies to deliver the files to
     each of the users at the specified destinations.   There  is
     no  limit  to  the  number of separate addresses that may be
     specified, but note that  the  first  non-flag  argument  is
     always  assumed  to be an address.  Subsequent arguments are
     also assumed to be addresses if  they  contain  any  of  the
     address  delimiters and don't exist as files.  The delimiter
     `::::' may be used instead of `@@@@'.  A _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n may  also  be
     specified   as   ****...._d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n,   for   _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t   routing,
     _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n!!!!_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n...   for  _e_x_p_l_i_c_i_t  routing,  or  as
     _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n,,,,_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n...   for _m_u_l_t_i_c_a_s_t routing, although
     these modes may be restricted to privileged  users  at  some
     sites.

     Destinations  are  usually  the  names  of  regions  in  the
     network,  where  a region consists of domain names separated
     by  periods,  as  in  _d_o_m_a_i_n_1...._d_o_m_a_i_n_2...._d_o_m_a_i_n_3.   Where   the
     destination  specifies  a single site, a period (`....') may be
     used instead of an `@@@@' or  `::::'.   Region  addresses  may  be
     shortened  to  exclude those domains which are common to the
     origin and destination, and there  may  be  other  shorthand
     forms  available  at  your  local  site  for  commonly  used
     destinations - check with your  local  administration.   See
     below for a full syntax for addresses.

     On arrival, files are spooled for users to be collected  via
     the command _n_e_t_g_e_t(1).

     The optional parameters have meanings as follows:

     ----aaaa  Requests that correct delivery of the  message  to  each
         destination  be  acknowledged.   The sender will receive
         the acknowledgement by mail.

     ----cccc  Requests that _e_n_d-_t_o-_e_n_d data checking be performed.   A
         CRC will be generated at the source, and checked at each
         destination.  If there is any error, the sender will  be
         notified by mail, and the message will not be delivered.

     ----FFFF _n_a_m_e
         _N_a_m_e will be interpreted explicitly as a file name.

     ----NNNN _n_a_m_e
         If _n_e_t_f_i_l_e is used as a filter, then this  flag  may  be
         used  to  provide  a name for its input.  The default is
         _s_t_d_i_n.  Otherwise, the next (or only) _f_i_l_e argument will
         be re-named to _n_a_m_e.

     ----   Data will be read from standard input at this point.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     If a _f_i_l_e argument is _n_u_l_l, it will cause an error,  but  if
     it  is  the  name of a directory, it will be ignored after a
     warning message.  If no files are specified,  data  will  be
     read from _s_t_d_i_n.

     To use _n_e_t_f_i_l_e, you must be validated  for  network  message
     privileges  by  your  local  system  supervisor,  unless the
     destination is  a `local' node.

     There are other flags primarily for use  by  programs  using
     _n_e_t_f_i_l_e to pump messages into the network:

     ----dddd  Prevents this  message  from  triggering  the  auto-call

     ----iiii  Causes _n_e_t_f_i_l_e  to  ignore  syntax  errors  in  multiple
         addresses,  provided  at  least  one of the addresses is
         correct.

         multiple smaller messages that are sent individually and
         re-assembled  at the destination.  This doesn't occur if
         the destination is directly connected to the origin,  or
         if  this  flag  is  used.  Only works for network _s_u_p_e_r-
         _u_s_e_r_s.

     ----nnnn  Prevents the message  receiving  handler  notifying  the
         recipient(s) via mail.

     ----oooo  Turns off message queueing optimization by  size.   This
         message  will  instead  be  sent  as  though it were the
         largest in its priority group.

     ----qqqq  Report the unique message ID generated on _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     ----rrrr  Requests that errors at destinations should be  ignored,
         otherwise  any  error  causes  the  whole  message to be
         returned with an explanation.

     ----ssss  Don't issue warnings on stderr.

     ----uuuu  Stops the usage message from being produced on _s_t_d_e_r_r if
         there is any argument error.

     ----xxxx  Set  reverse  charging  for  message.   Only  works  for
         network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r_s.

     ----AAAA _h_a_n_d_l_e_r
         The  message  will  be  passed   to   _h_a_n_d_l_e_r   at   the
         destination.  Standard file transfer handlers are: _f_i_l_e_r
         (the  default),  _m_a_i_l_e_r,  and  _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.   If  any  other
         handler  is  named,  it  must  be  registered  for  file
         transfer protocol  (see  _n_e_t_h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s(5)),  and  it  must
         exist  at both source and destination unless the ----rrrr flag
         is used, or the invoker has OTHERHANDLERS permission, in
         which  case  it need only exist at the destination.  The
         use of non-standard handlers is normally  restricted  to
         users with special network privileges.

     ----BBBB _a_d_d_r_e_s_s

         An explicit way of specifying a destination list.

     ----EEEE _f_l_a_g_s
         The string will be made available to the handler at  the
         destination   as   the   header   environment   variable
         ENV_FLAGS. Note that if the _f_l_a_g_s start with  `-',  then
         there must be no space after ----EEEE.

         Large messages will be split into  parts  not  exceeding
         this  size.   _S_i_z_e must be in the range 8192 to 2097152,
         unless the invoker has special network privileges.

     ----NNNN _n_a_m_e

         _n_a_m_e.

     ----OOOO[_o_r_i_g_i_n]
         Renames the source of the message  to  be  _o_r_i_g_i_n  which
         must  be  a  legal  address, unless the flag ----rrrr is used.
         Note that _o_r_i_g_i_n, if present, may not be preceded  by  a
         space.   This  flag  is restricted to the network _s_u_p_e_r-
         _u_s_e_r.

     ----PPPP _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
         Set the message priority in the range `1' (high) to  `9'
         (low).   Normal  message  priorities  are  determined by
         message  size,  with  smaller  messages  having   higher
         priority.  Messages with priorities greater than `4' are
         routed via the cheapest route, other messages taking the
         fastest  route.   Non-privileged  users  may  only lower
         their message's priority.

     ----QQQQ _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
         Specifies   a   restricted   address   of    the    form
         _u_s_e_r@@@@_d_e_s_t_l_i_s_t.

     ----RRRR[_a_d_d_r_e_s_s]

         Renames  the sender of the message to be _s_e_n_d_e_r.  If the
         @@@@_s_o_u_r_c_e part is present,  the  source  address  is  also
         changed,  as  for  the  ----OOOO flag.  _S_o_u_r_c_e must be a legal
         address, unless the flag ----rrrr is used.  Note that  _s_e_n_d_e_r,
         if  present,  may not be preceded by a space.  This flag
         is restricted to the network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.

     ----SSSS[_s_e_n_d_e_r]
         Renames the sender of the message to  be  _s_e_n_d_e_r.   Note
         that _s_e_n_d_e_r, if present, may not be preceded by a space.
         This flag  is  restricted  to  the  network  _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.
         Super-users  (_u_i_d  == 0) may inform _n_e_t_f_i_l_e what name to

     ----VVVV _p_r_i_v-_u_s_e_r
         Informs _n_e_t_f_i_l_e to use _p_r_i_v-_u_s_e_r rather than the invoker
         to  calculate  the  network  permissions  for  following
         arguments.  This  flag  is  restricted  to  the  network
         _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.

     ----XXXX _f_i_l_e
         The file named will  be  transmitted  _i_n-_p_l_a_c_e  (without
         being  copied  first).  If the file is on the same file-
         system as MHSnet, then it will be linked into the  spool
         area, othwerise it will be referenced directly (in which
         case it musn't be removed until  the  message  has  been
         transmitted).  CCCCaaaavvvveeeeaaaatttt: the file name must be a full path
         name; the file must be readable by the message transport
         system   (ie:   it  should  probably  have  public  read
         permission).

     ----YYYY _t_r_a_v_e_l-_t_i_m_e
         Specifies that the message has already  been  travelling
         for  _t_r_a_v_e_l-_t_i_m_e  seconds.  Useful for messages arriving
         from gateways.

     ----ZZZZ _t_i_m_e-_t_o-_d_i_e
         The message will be discarded on any route  which  takes
         more than _t_i_m_e-_t_o-_d_i_e seconds before delivery.

     If a destination is specified, but no user, then the message
     is sent to the person with the same name as the invoker.

     Most diagnostics indicate that you were attempting something
     illegal, so consult the local network supervisor for further
     advice.

     illegal <message> site
         The network doesn't believe that  the  selected  message
         type  can  be  serviced  at the destination named.  This
         information  is  obtained  from  the  optional   address
         validation    list    in    the   _h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s   file   (see
         _n_e_t_h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s(8)).

User Commands                                          NETFILE(1)



         You have used the ----AAAA flag and the requested  handler  is
         registered  for  a different protocol, or you don't have
         permission to  use  this  handler,  or  the  handler  is
         unregistered and you haven't specified ----rrrr.

     illegal user format
         The invoker has an address restriction, and the  address
         shown contains illegal characters (`@' or `%').

     No file specified, reading standard input...
         The first address  supplied  is  also  the  name  of  an
         existing  file.   (Try prefixing the address with ----BBBB, or
         using ----uuuu.)

     no permission
         You aren't validated to use the network,  or  to  use  a
         privileged network option.  This information is obtained
         from the optional user network privileges  list  in  the
         _n_e_t_p_r_i_v_s file (see _n_e_t_p_r_i_v_s(1)).

     no routefile
         _N_e_t_f_i_l_e was unable  to  read  the  routing  tables  into
         memory.

     not enough space
         The file system holding the network spool area  has  too
         little  space  left to spool another message.  Try again
         later (or try the ----XXXX flag).

     Because of the semantics of non-flag address arguments, if a
     file  name  containing  any  of the legal address separators
     appears immediately after a legal  address,  but  the  named
     file  doesn't  exist, then _n_e_t_f_i_l_e will attempt to interpret
     the name as an address.  Use of the  ----FFFF  flag  for  filename
     arguments avoids this problem.

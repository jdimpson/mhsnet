     _N_e_t_l_i_n_k_l_o_g prints out  call  and  transmission  reports  for
     links to other nodes directly connected to this one based on
     the contents of the links' log files.  If a  region  or  its
     alias  or  a  complex address is named, then _n_e_t_l_i_n_k_l_o_g will
     show details of each link on the  shortest  path(s),  unless
     the  regions  are  directly  connected to this one, in which
     case _n_e_t_l_i_n_k_l_o_g will always show the direct link.

     The data for each link are printed in  three  sections,  the
     first  from logs of calls to the sites, the second from logs
     of calls from the sites, and the third  from  the  transport
     daemon  logs.   The  last  10  lines  from the call logs are
     printed, followed by the last  22  lines  of  the  transport
     daemon logs.

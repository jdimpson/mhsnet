     _N_e_t_c_h_a_n_g_e invoked without any link arguments will  find  and
     mark  links  that have become inactive.  The routing changes
     so produced are then broadcast to appropriate parts  of  the
     network.   Any  messages that were queued for inactive links
     are then re-routed.

     _N_e_t_c_h_a_n_g_e is also invoked directly by the routing process to
     add  unidirectional inbound links created by new connections
     into the routing tables, and to  alter  links  whose  state-
     change  has  been signalled by transport daemons.  If a link
     changes  from  _d_o_w_n  to  _u_p,  the  _r_e-_r_o_u_t_i_n_g  directory  is
     searched for messages that may use the new link.

     The optional flags are:

     ----bbbb  Break the named link(s).

     ----dddd  Mark named links as _d_o_w_n.

     ----iiii  Changes refer to _i_n-_b_o_u_n_d direction only.

     ----oooo  Changes refer to _o_u_t-_b_o_u_n_d direction only.

     ----zzzz  Mark named links as _d_e_a_d.

     ----FFFF_f_l_a_g[,_f_l_a_g]
         Set  the  flag(s)   for   the   named   link(s).    (See
         _n_e_t_s_t_a_t_e(8).)

     ----LLLL _l_i_n_k_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
         Add new link, or change specific link.

     ----RRRR_f_i_l_t_e_r_p_r_o_g
         Set the _l_i_n_k _f_i_l_t_e_r for the  link  to  _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_r_o_g.   (To
         remove a filter, specify _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_r_o_g as `####'.)

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     If the NETADMIN option is in  effect,  then  _n_e_t_c_h_a_n_g_e  will
     send  mail  to the site administrator whenever a new link is

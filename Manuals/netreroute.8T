     _N_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e's primary purpose is to reroute  messages  queued
     in  the  holding  directory for looping messages, but it may
     also be used to manage link queues in general.

     When a  looping  message  is  detected,  (ie:  one  that  is
     attempting  to  traverse a particular link for the umpteenth
     time), the routing process  diverts  it  into  the  __p_e_n_d_i_n_g
     directory  and  informs  the  management.   Note  that these
     messages are automatically  re-routed  by  _n_e_t_p_u_r_g_e(8)  when
     invoked  with  its  ----rrrr  flag,  usually once a day.  However,
     _n_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e should be used to speed the rerouting, or to deal
     with   messages  which  cannot  be  automatically  rerouted.
     _N_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e is then invoked with two arguments, the first the
     defaulting  address,  and  the second the name of a suitable
     alternative link.  The _a_d_d_r_e_s_s argument  may  be  a  complex
     address to match a set of addresses.

     The optional third argument can be specified  to  force  the
     message  to  be  routed  via  the address _f_o_r_w_a_r_d-_v_i_a before
     continuing to its original destination.  However, note  that
     if _n_e_w-_l_i_n_k is the name of a site that is not a direct link,
     then the message will be _f_o_r_w_a_r_d_e_d to that site anyway.   In
     either   case,  any  existing  _e_x_p_l_i_c_i_t  addresses  will  be
     removed, and replaced with _n_e_w-_l_i_n_k.

     _N_e_w-_l_i_n_k may also be an address matching the local site,  in
     which  case  messages will be re-presented for routing using
     the routing tables.

     Alternatively, whole queues can be managed by specifying one
     of  the  flags ----bbbb, ----dddd or ----ffff, when the first address argument
     should be the name of the link whose queue will be rerouted.
     Using  the flag ----aaaa causes all messages in the holding queues
     to be re-routed.

     Any messages queued in the holding  directory  __r_e_r_o_u_t_e  are
     also re-routed if their destinations match _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     Note that the holding directory  for  looping  messages  may
     also  contain messages whose addresses are unroutable, which
     you may need to  return  to  their  origin  with  _n_e_t_s_t_o_p(1)
     unless  you  know  of a suitable intermediate site with more
     routing information.

     _N_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e attempts to establish a _l_o_c_k file in each of  the
     directories as it re-routes messages from them.  If the lock
     can't be made, then  _n_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e  prints  a  warning  message
     before continuing with another directory.

     The optional flags are:

     ----aaaa  Cause all messages in  the  holding  queues  to  be  re-
         routed.  May only be used with the ----eeee and ----ssss flags.

     ----bbbb  Break the link to _o_l_d-_l_i_n_k. (Turns  on  flag  ffff.)   Note
         that  this  will  only break the _o_u_t-_b_o_u_n_d side of links
         with a filter specified, so that any messages  re-routed
         can be properly _d_e-_f_i_l_t_e_r_e_d.

     ----dddd  Mark the link to _o_l_d-_l_i_n_k as _d_e_a_d.  (Turns on flag ffff.)

     ----eeee  Search the __b_a_d directory for undamaged messages  to  be
         re-routed.

     ----ffff  Force all messages queued for _o_l_d-_l_i_n_k  to  be  rerouted
         via _n_e_w-_l_i_n_k.

     ----ssss  Don't report number of messages re-routed.

     ----vvvv  Show each message rerouted.

     ----LLLL _l_i_n_k
         Use _l_i_n_k as  the  link  which  is  to  be  searched  for
         messages with addresses that match _a_d_d_r_e_s_s which will be
         forwarded via _n_e_w-_l_i_n_k.

     ----PPPP _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
         Only move messages with priorities higher than or  equal
         to _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

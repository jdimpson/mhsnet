.SH NAME
netlinklog \- show network link logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI \*(S6
.IR linkname | \|region | \|address \ ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(S2
prints out call and transmission reports for links to other nodes
directly connected to this one
based on the contents of the links' log files.
If a region or its alias or a complex address is named, then
\*(S3
will show details of each link on the shortest path(s),
unless the regions are directly connected to this one,
in which case \*(S3 will always show the direct link.
.PP
The data for each link are printed in three sections,
the first from logs of calls to the sites,
the second from logs of calls from the sites,
and the third from the transport daemon logs.
The last 10 lines from the call logs are printed,
followed by the last 22 lines of the transport daemon logs.
.SH EXAMPLES
Show the status of the last connection to `site':

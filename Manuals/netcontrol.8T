     _N_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l is used to send commands to _n_e_t_i_n_i_t(8).  Commands
     are transmitted via a file, normally _lib/netinit.args.

     _N_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l will pause while _n_e_t_i_n_i_t processes  the  command,
     after  which  _n_e_t_i_n_i_t  will  print  any  reply or diagnostic
     directly to the file specified by _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l, and then  send
     a signal to _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l to terminate.

     The optional flags are:

     ----ffff  Force  communication  with  _n_e_t_i_n_i_t,  even  if   another
         instance  of  _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l  is  active.  If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
         "shutdown", then any errors will  cause  _n_e_t_i_n_i_t  to  be
         sent  the  SIGTERM  signal,  otherwise  this will merely
         cause _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l to try  to  establish  the  lock  three
         times.

     ----ssss  Silent - don't report result of command.

     ----vvvv  Validate lock file time.

     ----LLLL _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
         This flag cause _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l to check the  lockfile  named
         by concatenating SPOOLDIR with _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y and `lock', and
         returning the status of the  daemon  in  the  exit  code
         (non-zero  if  the  daemon  is  inactive).  If ----ssss is not
         specified, the process ID of any active daemon  will  be
         printed,  together  with  the nodename in parentheses if
         running on a different node to the invoker.   If  ----vvvv  is
         specified,  the  exit  code  will  be  non-zero  if  the
         lockfile modify time appears  to  pre-date  system  boot
         (based on return value of the _t_i_m_e_s(2) system call), and
         if ----ssss is  not  specified,  a  warning  message  will  be
         printed.

     ----FFFF _f_i_l_e
         _F_i_l_e becomes the output file for communicating with  the
         invoker.  By default this is `/dev/tty', unless it isn't
         publicly writable, in which  case  the  default  becomes
         `_lib/netinit.reply'   which   is  then  copied  to  the
         invoker's terminal by _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

         processes will be noted but not enabled.  Processes  for
         which  the  information  (command  arguments  etc.)  has

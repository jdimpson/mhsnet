     _N_e_t_l_i_n_k prints out  statistics  for  links  to  other  nodes
     directly  connected to this one based on the contents of the
     links' status files.  By default, _n_e_t_l_i_n_k  will  search  the
     spool  area  for  links  and  print out details for each one
     found, but if particular links are named in  the  arguments,
     then  the search will be restricted to just those mentioned.
     If a region or its alias or a complex address is named, then
     _n_e_t_l_i_n_k  will  show  details  of  each  link on the shortest
     path(s), unless the regions are directly connected  to  this
     one, in which case _n_e_t_l_i_n_k will always show the direct link.

     The optional flags are:

     ----cccc[_s_e_c_s]
         Causes _n_e_t_l_i_n_k to repeat the display every _s_e_c_s  seconds
         [default: 4].

     ----hhhh  Don't print the header for the non-verbose listing.

     ----rrrr  Show I/O rates on compact output, instead of the message
         and byte counts.

     ----tttt  Show totals  for  all  channels  in  each  direction  on
         verbose output.

     ----vvvv  Verbose - the details include the state of the link, the
         throughputs  achieved,  and  the status of each channel.
         Super-users also get shown the process _i_d of the daemon.
         Without  ----vvvv,  a more compact format containing a summary
         of the available information is presented.

     ----wwww  Complain about missing links.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l [default 1].   If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     The verbose display shows  throughputs  and  errors  on  the
     link.   The _a_v_e_r_a_g_e numbers are for recent (decay rate half-
     life of ~60 seconds) throughput achieved while the  link  is
     _a_c_t_i_v_e,  ie: transferring messages.  The _c_u_r_r_e_n_t numbers are
     for the last scan period, and the _o_v_e_r_a_l_l  numbers  are  for
     the  total  throughput  since the link was started.  The _r_a_w

     data  includes  all  bytes  transmitted,  but  the  _a_v_e_r_a_g_e,
     _c_u_r_r_e_n_t,  _o_v_e_r_a_l_l, and _b_y_t_e_s figures are for error corrected
     message data.  Each number on the `Total' line is the sum of
     the two in the column above.

     Errors are shown as  `errs'  on  the  `Protocol'  line,  and
     represent  a total of all packet errors for both directions,
     whereas `skip' are input  bytes  ignored  because  they  are
     unexpected,  or parts of packets with corrupted headers.  If
     `skip'  or  `errs'  change  in  value,  asterisks  will   be
     displayed  momentarily to draw your attention.  The protocol
     line will display `cook 0' if  the  virtual  circuit  is  in
     `ascii'  mode (`cook 1' in XON/XOFF mode), and `data CRC' if
     CRC checks have been  enabled.   The  line  will  also  show
     `1/2dplx  in'  or  `1/2dplx  out'  when in _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d (half-
     duplex) mode,  or  `in  only'  or  `out  only'  if  in  _u_n_i-
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n_a_l  mode.  _d__s_i_z_e indicates the current packet data
     size, however, if the output and input packet data sizes are
     different, then _o_s_i_z_e and _i_s_i_z_e will be printed instead.

     The _C_h_a_n_n_e_l_s statistics show the  progress  of  messages  on
     each  channel  (four channels in each direction).  Note that
     the _M_e_s_s_a_g_e column  shows  the  percentage  of  the  message
     transferred so far, (for inbound messages, this may be lower
     than expected if parts of the  message  are  awaiting  error
     correction).

     _N_e_t_m_s_g inserts non-FTP  messages  into  the  network  to  be
     transmitted  to  remote  destinations.   (See _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1) for
     sending messages using the `File Transfer  Protocol',  which
     includes the ability to send messages to particular users.)

     The network will generate  the  minimal  number  of  message
     copies  to  deliver  the  message  to  each of the specified
     destinations.  There is no limit to the number  of  separate
     destinations  that may be specified, but note that the first
     non-flag argument is always assumed to be a destination.   A
     _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n  may  also  be  specified  as ****...._d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n, for
     _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t routing, _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n!!!!_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n...  for  _e_x_p_l_i_c_i_t
     routing,  or  as  _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n,,,,_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n...   for _m_u_l_t_i_c_a_s_t
     routing,  although  these  modes  may   be   restricted   to
     privileged users at some sites.

     Destinations  are  usually  the  names  of  regions  in  the
     network,  where  a region consists of domain names separated
     by periods, as in _d_o_m_a_i_n_1...._d_o_m_a_i_n_2...._d_o_m_a_i_n_3.  Region addresses
     may  be  shortened to exclude those domains which are common
     to the origin  and  destination,  and  there  may  be  other
     shorthand  forms  available  at your local site for commonly
     used destinations - check with  your  local  administration.
     See below for a full syntax for destination addresses.

     If a _f_i_l_e argument is _n_u_l_l, it will cause an error,  but  if
     it  is  the  name of a directory, it will be ignored after a
     warning  message.   File  arguments  supply  data  for   the
     message,  and  are  concatenated  in the order given.  If no
     files are specified, data will be read from _s_t_d_i_n.

     To use _n_e_t_m_s_g, you must be  validated  for  network  message
     privileges  by  your  local  system  supervisor,  unless the
     destination is a `local' node.

     The flag arguments have meanings as follows:

     ----aaaa  Requests that correct delivery of the  message  to  each
         destination   be   acknowledged.   Acknowledgements  are
         handled in a way specific to each message handler.

     ----dddd  Prevents this  message  from  triggering  the  auto-call
         mechanism if present.

     ----iiii  Causes  _n_e_t_m_s_g  to  ignore  syntax  errors  in  multiple
         destinations,  provided at least one of the destinations
         is correct.

     ----mmmm  Messages over a  certain  size  (normally  set  by  site
         administrators  to  be  2  megabytes),  are  split  into
         multiple smaller messages that are sent individually and
         re-assembled  at the destination.  This doesn't occur if
         the destination is directly connected to the origin,  or
         if  this  flag  is  used.  Only works for network _s_u_p_e_r-
         _u_s_e_r_s.

     ----oooo  Turns off message queueing optimization by  size.   This
         message  will  instead  be  sent  as  though it were the
         largest in its priority group.

     ----qqqq  Report the unique message ID generated on _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     ----rrrr  Requests that errors at destinations should be  ignored,
         otherwise  any  error  causes  the  whole  message to be
         returned with an explanation.

     ----ssss  Don't issue warnings on stderr.

     ----uuuu  Stops the usage message from being produced on _s_t_d_e_r_r if
         there is any argument error.

     ----xxxx  Set  reverse  charging  for  message.   Only  works  for
         network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r_s.

     ----AAAA _h_a_n_d_l_e_r
         The  message  will  be  passed   to   _h_a_n_d_l_e_r   at   the
         destination.  The handler must not be one registered for
         any of the standard protocols (see _n_e_t_h_a_n_d_l_e_r_s(5)),  and
         it  must exist at both source and destination unless the
         ----rrrr flag  is  used,  or  the  invoker  has  OTHERHANDLERS
         permission,  in  which  case  it  need only exist at the
         destination.   The  use  of  non-standard  handlers   is
         normally   restricted  to  users  with  special  network
         privileges.  This argument must be present.

     ----DDDD _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
         An explicit way of specifying a destination list.

     ----EEEE _f_l_a_g_s
         The string will be made available to the handler at  the
         destination   as   the   header   environment   variable
         ENV_FLAGS.

     ----FFFF _n_a_m_e
         _N_a_m_e will be interpreted explicitly as a file name.

     ----IIII _I_D
         Insert  a  message  ID  into  the  environment  variable
         ENV_ID.

     ----MMMM _s_i_z_e
         Large messages will be split into  parts  not  exceeding
         this  size.   _S_i_z_e must be in the range 8192 to 2097152,
         unless the invoker has special network privileges.

     ----OOOO[_o_r_i_g_i_n]
         Renames the source of the message  to  be  _o_r_i_g_i_n  which
         must  be  a  legal  address, unless the flag ----rrrr is used.
         Note that _o_r_i_g_i_n, if present, may not be preceded  by  a
         space.   This  flag  is restricted to the network _s_u_p_e_r-
         _u_s_e_r.

     ----PPPP _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
         Set the message priority in the range `1' (high) to  `9'
         (low).   Normal  message  priorities  are  determined by
         message  size,  with  smaller  messages  having   higher
         priority.  Messages with priorities greater than `4' are
         routed via the cheapest route, other messages taking the
         fastest  route.   Non-privileged  users  may  only lower
         their message's priority.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l.  If tracing is  not  compiled
         in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----VVVV _p_r_i_v-_u_s_e_r
         Informs _n_e_t_m_s_g to use _p_r_i_v-_u_s_e_r rather than the  invoker
         to  calculate  the  network  permissions  for  following
         arguments.  This  flag  is  restricted  to  the  network
         _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.

     ----XXXX _f_i_l_e
         Data from the file named will  be  transmitted  _i_n-_p_l_a_c_e
         (without  being  copied  first).   If the file is on the
         same file-system as MHSnet, then it will be linked  into
         the spool area, othwerise it will be referenced directly
         (in which case it musn't be removed  until  the  message
         has  been transmitted).  CCCCaaaavvvveeeeaaaatttt: the file name must be a
         full path name; the file must be readable by the message
         transport  system  (ie:  it  should probably have public
         read permission).

     ----YYYY _t_r_a_v_e_l-_t_i_m_e
         Specifies that the message has already  been  travelling
         for  _t_r_a_v_e_l-_t_i_m_e  seconds.  Useful for messages arriving
         from gateways.

         The message will be discarded on any route  which  takes
         more than _t_i_m_e-_t_o-_d_i_e seconds before delivery.

     Most diagnostics indicate that you were attempting something
     illegal, so consult the local network supervisor for further
     advice.

     illegal handler  The requested handler is either  registered
                      for  a standard protocol, or you don't have
                      permission to  use  this  handler,  or  the

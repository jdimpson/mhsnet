     _N_e_t_s_t_o_p searches the network spool area for links to  remote
     hosts,  and,  by  interaction  with  the  invoker, de-queues
     messages  sent   by   the   invoker   which   are   awaiting
     transmission.

     If any links are mentioned,  the  search  is  restricted  to
     those  named.   Addresses  may  also  be specified, and then
     _n_e_t_s_t_o_p will only select links  on  the  shortest  paths  to
     destinations  matched by each address.  If only one non-link
     destination is named in an address argument, then the search
     will be restricted to messages matched by _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     Any messages originating off site, or that don't  belong  to
     the  invoker,  will  be  returned  to  their  source with an
     accompanying return reason.

     The optional flags modify this behaviour:

     ----aaaa  Select all messages queued.  (This option is  restricted
         to  network  _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r_s.)   Messages  from remote sites
         stopped in this way are returned to their source with an
         appropriate reason.

     ----bbbb  Search the __b_a_d directory for failed  messages  awaiting
         operator intervention.  (See _n_e_t_b_a_d(8).)

     ----cccc  Return the messages queued count in the exit status.

     ----ddddeeeelllleeeetttteeee
         Assume the answer `delete' to any questions.

     ----eeee  Ignore any message header error, and print  it  out  `as
         is'.

     ----ffff  Fast search (no message details).

     ----hhhh  Show message headers.

     ----kkkk  Show commands from message description file.

     ----llll  Search  the  _p_e_n_d_i_n_g  directory  for  looping   messages
         awaiting operator re-routing.  (See _n_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e(8).)

     ----mmmm  Show message queueing details from message descriptors.

     ----nnnn  Prevent  _n_e_t_s_t_o_p  from  returning  messages  you  didn't
         originate.

     ----pppp  Search  the  _p_e_n_d_i_n_g  directory  for  looping   messages
         awaiting operator re-routing.  (See _n_e_t_r_e_r_o_u_t_e(8).)

     ----qqqq  Search the _r_o_u_t_i_n_g directory  for  messages  queued  for
         routing by the _r_o_u_t_e_r process.

     ----rrrr  Search  the  _r_e_r_o_u_t_e  directory  for  messages  awaiting
         automatic re-routing.

     ----ssss  Silent mode.  (For use with the ----cccc and/or ----yyyy flags.)

     ----tttt  Search the _t_r_a_c_e directory for snapshot messages.

     ----vvvv  Print details from any FTP header (such as file  names),
         also  print  entire  addresses  (the  normal  format can
         truncate  overlong  addresses).   This  flag  is  on  by
         default.

     ----wwww  Complain about irregularities.

     ----xxxx  Search all messages directories.

     ----yyyy  Yes.  Assume a positive response to all queries.

     ----AAAA _h_a_n_d_l_e_r
         Restrict the search to just messages of type _h_a_n_d_l_e_r.

     ----DDDD _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
         Restrict  the  search  to  messages  whose   _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
         address matches _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     ----PPPP _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y
         Use _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y when  looking  up  the  links  for  address
         arguments.

     ----RRRR _r_e_a_s_o_n
         Set the  _s_t_o_p  _r_e_a_s_o_n  appended  to  messages  that  are
         returned.  [Default: `Message returned by operator'.]

     ----SSSS _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
         Restrict the search to  messages  whose  _s_o_u_r_c_e  address
         matches _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----UUUU _u_s_e_r
         Look for messages from _u_s_e_r  rather  than  the  invoker.

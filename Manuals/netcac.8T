     _N_e_t_c_a_c  is  a  shell  program  that   summaries   connection
     statistics  from  the  connect  log.   The optional argument
     names a particular link  to  be  summarised,  otherwise  all
     links are summarised.

     The flags are as follows:

     ----DDDD  Turn on debugging - will complain  about  missing  input
         records.

     ----aaaa  Print both IN and OUT statistics.

     ----cccc _c_o_s_t
         Calculate cost for connection using _c_o_s_t  as  the  money
         value per hour of connect time.

     ----dddd  Show `down' time.

     ----ffff _f_i_l_e
         Take statistics from an alternate file.  If _f_i_l_e is `-',
         then read from _s_t_d_i_n.

     ----hhhh  Print a header describing each column of output.

     ----iiii _l_i_n_k
         Add _l_i_n_k to list of ignored links, that will be excluded
         from the statistics.

     ----kkkk _k_b_y_t_e_s
         Selects only those  connections  that  transferred  more
         than _k_b_y_t_e_s thousand bytes.

     ----mmmm _m_i_n_s
         Selects only those connections  that  lasted  more  than
         _m_i_n_s minutes.

     ----rrrr  Causes a throughput rate to be calculated for the  total
         time logged.

     ----ssss  Strip types from domain names (default shows  `internal'
         type for each domain name).

     ----uuuu  Round-up all connection times to nearest minute.

     ----vvvv  _V_e_r_b_o_s_e listing: one line for every connection.

     Print   connection   statistics   summary   for   link    to
     `tmx.mhs.oz.au',  with  a  header  for  each field, limiting
     selection to connections lasting more than  10  minutes  and
     transferring more than 10Kb, and print an overall throughput
     rate:

     Each line in the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t file has 8 or 9 fields as  follows:
     start-date, start-time, weekday, direction, typed-link-name,
     elapsed-time, messages and data-bytes.   An  optional  ninth
     field   usually  contains  a  circuit-specific  description.
     _U_n_i-_p_r_o_c_e_s_s daemons write a single line with  the  direction
     marked as i&o.

     _stats/connect  Connect accounting file with two  lines  per
                     connection.  If this file does not exist, or
                     is unwritable, then  connect  accounting  is
                     disabled.
     _stats/connect._y_y_m_m_d_d
                     If  connect  accounting  is  enabled,  these
                     files  are  created by rotating _c_o_n_n_e_c_t once
                     every   week   (by    the    shell    script
                     _lib/weekly).
     __s_t_a_t_s/_c_o_n_n_e_c_t._y_y_m_m._Z
                     If  connect  accounting  is  enabled,  these
                     files  are  created by concatenating _c_o_n_n_e_c_t
                     files for the previous month at the start of
                     a   new   month   (by   the   shell   script
                     _stats/turn-acct).

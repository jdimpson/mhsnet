     _N_e_t_c_h_e_c_k_d_b removes  timed-out  records  from  the  broadcast
     message  tracking database, and creates a (possibly) sparser
     copy.

     The database maintains a list of  message-ID/source  address
     pairs  that  enable  the routing program to reject duplicate
     broadcast messages.  The data-base is maintained as a direct
     access sparse file with a 15-bit key produced by hashing the
     message-ID and source address.  Each key  defines  a  _b_u_c_k_e_t
     that  can hold up to four records of 32 bytes each, allowing
     the data base to track a maximum 128K messages,  reaching  a
     maximum  size  of 4 megabytes.  Since all broadcast messages
     have time-outs set (at around one week), the entries in  the
     data-base expire after a certain time, leaving holes.

     Periodic  rewriting  may  save  file-system  space,  but  is
     otherwise unnecessary.

     The optional flags are:

     ----cccc  Check data-base only.

     ----rrrr  Ignore routing daemon.  Otherwise _n_e_t_c_h_e_c_k_d_b will refuse
         to  modify  the  data-base  if  the  routing  daemon  is
         running, unless the ----cccc or ----OOOO flags are used.

     ----ssss  Silent mode - don't show compaction statistics.

     ----vvvv  Verbose mode - show  extra  compaction  statistics,  and
         describe each active record found.

     ----OOOO _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
         Write clean output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e instead of rewriting  the
         old database.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

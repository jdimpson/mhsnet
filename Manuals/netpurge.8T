     _N_e_t_p_u_r_g_e searches the network spool area for message command
     file  directories  (such  as  _l_i_n_k  directories  for  remote
     hosts), and builds a reference list for  each  message  data
     file  referred  to by any message command files found in the
     directories.  Any message  command  files  found  that  have
     timed  out  are  removed.   Any  files  then found in a work
     directory  which  have  not  been  referenced  are  removed.
     However,  if  any  `bad'  command files are discovered, then
     _n_e_t_p_u_r_g_e will not remove any unreferenced  files,  and  will
     notify  NCC_ADMIN  via  mail (unless the `-m' flag is used).
     NCC_ADMIN will also  be  notified  if  any  other  exception
     conditions are encountered.

     If any _s_e_a_r_c_h__n_a_m_e (last component of a message  file  name)
     arguments  are  given,  then  _n_e_t_p_u_r_g_e  will report on their
     existence if found in a directory or message  command  file,
     however, no files will be removed.

     The optional flags modify this behaviour:

     ----aaaa  Remove   all   unreferenced    files    unconditionally.
         Otherwise unreferenced files that are less than 24 hours
         old are untouched.  Only use this flag if the network is
         inactive.

     ----dddd  Remove empty directories from multi-part message tree.

     ----ffff  Remove timed-out messages from received  files  spooling
         directory.

     ----llll  Remove lock files.  Only if the owner is not active,  or
         the flag ----aaaa is specified.  (NB: this will not remove the
         lockfile for _n_e_t_i_n_i_t(8).)

     ----mmmm  Don't  send  mail  to  NCC_ADMIN  when   inconsistencies
         detected.

     ----rrrr  Try routing any messages  awaiting  operator  re-routing
         that have been waiting more than 24 hours.

     ----ssss  Silent.  Don't report number of files removed.

     ----tttt  Search the `_trace' directory  for  messages  that  have
         timed-out  and  remove  them.  (Trace messages have a 24
         hour timeout.)

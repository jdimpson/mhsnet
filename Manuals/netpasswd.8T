     _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d  creates  or  modifies  entries  in  the   network
     password  file.   _A_d_d_r_e_s_s  can  be  any  locally  resolvable
     network address, and will protect connections from any sites
     whose  node names match it, unless it is a broadcast address
     matching a site that has a valid entry in the  `/etc/passwd'
     file - which takes precedence.  Any additional arguments are
     written to the entry's comment field.

     Adding an entry for a broadcast address is also the  way  to
     allow  _p_r_o_m_i_s_c_u_o_u_s  connections  to  your site from any site
     within the broadcast region.

     _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d sorts the password file in reverse  typed  address
     order  so that _n_e_t_s_h_e_l_l(8) can scan it looking for the first
     entry to match a calling site.  In  this  way,  a  broadcast
     entry for a region can be overridden by an entry specific to
     a particular site.

     _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d will warn you if there is an  entry  matching  the
     _a_d_d_r_e_s_s   argument   with   a   non-null   password  in  the
     `/etc/passwd' file.  If you  wish  to  ignore  `/etc/passwd'
     entries  and  force all sites to be checked against matching
     network  passwords,  then  you  should  set  the   parameter
     IGN_ETCPASSWD  to  1111 in the parameters file `_params/daemon'
     (see _n_e_t_s_h_e_l_l(_8)).

     _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d turns off echo when prompting  for  the  password,
     which  can  be  up  to  127  characters  in  length  (excess
     characters  are  ignored).   An  empty  line   removes   the
     password.

     The optional flags are:

     ----cccc  Check the password for _a_d_d_r_e_s_s, instead of  creating  or
         modifying it.

     ----dddd  Delete the entry for _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     ----nnnn  Create a null password entry for _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.

     ----pppp  Print the passwd file.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l [default: 1].  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     Create password protection for a local site `castor':

       _bin/netpasswd castor

     Create  password   protection   for   all   sites   in   our
     organisation:

       _bin/netpasswd *.mhs.oz.au all sites except castor

     All sites except `castor' (which has its own password)  will
     then  be prompted for the organisation password.  The string
     ``all sites except castor'' will  be  placed  in  the  third
     field of castor's entry.

     Create password protection for, and validate  a  promiscuous
     connection from, a foreign site:

       _bin/netpasswd NODE=pollux.ORG=XYZ.PRMD=com.COUNTRY=au

     On  starting,  _n_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d  reads  a  file  in  the  `_params'
     directory  with the same name as it was invoked under.  This
     file can contain the following optional parameters:

     PASSWDSORT
         This is the command string used  to  sort  the  password
         file by passing it to the shell.  The default is:

         `sort -t. +1nr %s -o %s'

         It must sort the passwd file in  reverse  order  on  the
         leading  chars  after the first period, with input taken
         from the file named by the first `%s', and  output  sent
         to the file named by the second `%s'.

     Could not exec "sort ..."
         _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d runs _s_o_r_t(1)  to  sort  the  network  password
         file.   If the sort fails, then you must fix the problem
         and  try  again.   On  some  systems  you  must   invoke
         _n_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d  as "root" for sort to work, on others you may
         be able to fix the problem by changing PASSWDSORT above

     Could not open "/dev/tty"
         _N_e_t_p_a_s_s_w_d opens /_d_e_v/_t_t_y to prompt  for  passwords.   If
         your  real  terminal device is unwriteable by your group
         id, this message  may  result.   You  can  "chmod  ug+rw
         `tty`" and try again.

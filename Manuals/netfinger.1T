     _N_e_t_f_i_n_g_e_r will obtain user information from  internet  hosts
     by  using  the  internet  _f_i_n_g_e_r(1) program on the indicated
     _f_i_n_g_e_r__h_o_s_t.  [Default: the local host.]

     Names, if provided, are passed to the corresponding host for
     perusal.  Information  returned includes the login name, the
     user's real names, and details of last login time  for  each
     match.   A  particular account will match if the login name,
     or any one of the real names of the  user  matches  exactly.
     Pattern matching is case insensitive.

     If no name is provided for any given host, a list  of  users
     currently logged on is returned instead.

     Query information and errors are returned by the _f_i_n_g_e_r__h_o_s_t
     executing _n_e_t_m_a_i_l(1) with appropriate arguments.

     Please note that regular expressions in the name will not be
     interpreted as such.

     Obtain a list of users currently logged on to a little known
     host  in  the  Basser  Department of Computer Science at the
     University of Sydney:

     Consult  _n_e_t_m_s_g(8)  for  possible  diagnostic  messages,  as
     _n_e_t_f_i_n_g_e_r  invokes  that  program to send the requests.  See
     _f_i_n_g_e_r(1) for error message details returned via  electronic
     mail when a query fails, or a host cannot be contacted.

     Please note that the finger program often provides incorrect
     information about the time of last login.

     _N_e_t_i_n_i_t  runs  network  processes  described  in  the   file
     `_lib/initfile'.

     Each program that is to be run by _n_e_t_i_n_i_t has  an  entry  in
     _i_n_i_t_f_i_l_e of the form:

       _p_r_o_c_e_s_s-_i_d  _p_r_o_c_e_s_s-_t_y_p_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The _p_r_o_c_e_s_s-_i_d starts at the beginning of  a  line.   It  is
     used  as an identifier for the process when _n_e_t_i_n_i_t is asked
     by _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l(8) to start or stop it.  The three fields  are
     delimited  by  space, tab, or a newline followed by space or
     tab.

     The _p_r_o_c_e_s_s-_t_y_p_e can be one of the following:

       rrrreeeessssttttaaaarrrrtttt
           The process will be started immediately, and restarted
           every  time  it terminates.  However, if it terminates
           in less than a minute, it will be delayed before being
           restarted by an increasing amount up to 6 minutes.

       rrrruuuunnnnoooonnnncccceeee
           The process will  be  run  once  every  time  a  _s_t_a_r_t
           command from _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l is received for it.

       ````ssssttttrrrriiiinnnngggg''''
           A specification of the time to run the process in  the
           same  form as that used by _c_r_o_n(8), enclosed in double
           quotes.

     The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d specifies  a  _s_h_e_l_l  command  to  execute  using
     `/bin/sh'   (see  _s_h(1)).   Processes  will  be  started  or
     restarted on the minute.

     Lines  beginning  with  white  space  are   interpreted   as
     continuations   of   the   current  entry.   An  empty  line
     terminates an entry and  a  line  beginning  with  non-white
     space  signifies  the  beginning  of  a new entry.  Comments
     begin with a #### character and end at a newline.

     _N_e_t_i_n_i_t will check  the  modify  time  of  _i_n_i_t_f_i_l_e  once  a
     minute, and rescan the contents if it changes.  See also the
     _s_c_a_n command in _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l(8).

     The optional flags for _n_e_t_i_n_i_t are:

     ----ffff  Don't fork off parent when starting.  When this flag  is
         specified  and  _n_e_t_i_n_i_t's  parent  is _i_n_i_t, _n_e_t_i_n_i_t will
         pause when the sssshhhhuuuuttttddddoooowwwwnnnn command is complete.  A  further
         _S_I_G_T_E_R_M is required to cause _n_e_t_i_n_i_t to exit.

     ----LLLL _l_o_g-_f_i_l_e
         Write logging information to the file _l_o_g-_f_i_l_e (default:
         "_lib/log").

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     _N_e_t_i_n_i_t will immediately  run  the  commands  _r_o_u_t_e_r,  _c_a_l_l-
     _b_a_s_s_e_r  and  _c_a_l_l-_m_a_n_g_o,  and  will  restart  them  if  they
     terminate.  The other  entries  in  the  file  specify  that
     commands are to be run at particular times.

     Note that if any of the commands are to become a target  for
     the  _n_e_t_r_o_u_t_e_r(8)  _a_u_t_o-_c_a_l_l  facility,  then the link names
     should be specified fully, as in
     `call-basser.cs.su.oz.au'.

     _N_e_t_i_n_i_t alters its argument list to indicate current status.
     The  result  has  two  fields:  program  name, and number of
     active children.  On BSD systems, the _p_s(1) output shows the
     altered argument list.

     If there is a negative system time change of  more  than  10
     seconds  (the  period  set  in the NVETIMECHANGE parameter),
     _n_e_t_i_n_i_t will mail the people  identified  in  the  NCC_ADMIN
     parameter  (including  `root',  if  not specified), and shut
     down the network for 10  minutes  (the  period  set  in  the
     NVETIMEDELAY    parameter).    Use   _k_i_l_l(1)   followed   by
     _n_e_t_s_t_a_r_t(8) to restart it sooner.

     If any program started by _n_e_t_i_n_i_t terminates  with  a  _c_o_r_e,
     then  _n_e_t_i_n_i_t  will  disable the process and mail the person
     identified in the NCC_ADMIN parameter.

     If any program started by _n_e_t_i_n_i_t terminates with an  error,
     the  error reason is reported in the log (see the respective
     program manual for error explanation).

     If any process with a _p_r_o_c_e_s_s-_t_y_p_e of `restart'  terminates,
     the time and PID are logged.

     All _n_e_t_c_o_n_t_r_o_l commands and process starts are logged.

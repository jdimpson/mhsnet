.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI \*(S6
[\-[\fBh\fP][\fBv\fP]]
[\-\fBc\fP[\fIsleep\fP]]
.RI [ linkname | \|region | \|address
\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(S2
prints out statistics for links to other nodes
directly connected to this one
based on the contents of the links' status files.
By default,
\*(S3
will search the spool area for links
and print out details for each one found,
but if particular links are named in the arguments,
then the search will be restricted to just those mentioned.
If a region or its alias or a complex address is named, then
\*(S3
will show details of each link on the shortest path(s),
unless the regions are directly connected to this one,
in which case \*(S3 will always show the direct link.
.PP
The optional flags are:
.if n .ds tw 4
.if t .ds tw \w'\fB\-c\fP\fI[secs]\fPX'u
.TP "\*(tw"
.BI \-c \fR[\fPsecs\fR]\fP
Causes \*(S3 to repeat the display every
.I secs
seconds [default: 4].
.TP
.BI \-h
Don't print the header for the non-verbose listing.
.TP
.BI \-r
Show I/O rates on compact output,
instead of the message and byte counts.
.TP
.BI \-t
Show totals for all channels in each direction on verbose output.
.TP
.BI \-v
Verbose \(em
the details include the state of the link,
the throughputs achieved,
and the status of each channel.
Super-users also get shown the process
.I id
of the daemon.
Without
.BR \-v ,
a more compact format containing a summary
of the available information is presented.
.TP
.BI \-w
Complain about missing links.
.TP
.BI \-T \fR[\fPlevel\fR]\fP
Turns on tracing at
.I level
[default 1].
If tracing is not compiled in,
this flag will have no effect.
.TP
.BI \-?
Explain argument options and exit.
.PP
The verbose display shows throughputs and errors on the link.
The
.I average
numbers are for recent
(decay rate half-life of ~60 seconds)
throughput achieved while the link is
.IR active ,
ie: transferring messages.
The
.I current
numbers are for the last scan period,
and the
.I overall
numbers are for the total throughput since the link was started.
The
.I raw
data includes all bytes transmitted,
but the
.IR average ,
.IR current ,
.IR overall ,
and
.I bytes
figures are for error corrected message data.
Each number on the
`Total'
line is the sum of the two in the column above.
.PP
Errors are shown as `errs' on the
`Protocol'
line,
and represent a total of all packet errors
for both directions,
whereas
`skip'
are input bytes ignored because they are unexpected,
or parts of packets with corrupted headers.
If
`skip'
or
`errs'
change in value,
asterisks will be displayed momentarily to draw your attention.
The protocol line will display
`cook 0'
if the virtual circuit is in `ascii' mode
(`cook 1' in \s-1XON/XOFF\s0 mode),
and
`data \s-1CRC\s0'
if \s-1CRC\s0 checks have been enabled.
The line will also show
`1/2dplx in' or `1/2dplx out'
when in
.I turnaround
(half-duplex) mode,
or
`in only' or `out only'
if in
.I uni-directional
mode.
.I "d_size"
indicates the current packet data size,
however, if the output and input packet data sizes are different,
then
.I "osize"
and
.I "isize"
will be printed instead.
.PP
The
.I Channels
statistics show the progress of messages on each channel
(four channels in each direction).
Note that the 
.I Message
column shows the percentage of the message transferred so far,
(for inbound messages, this may be lower than expected if
parts of the message are awaiting error correction).
.if \n(S3 \{\
.PP
Note that links using the \s-1SUN III\s0 compatible daemons
have different statistics collected,
which are coerced into the format above,
and may not be accurate.
For a `true' picture of such links,
use the \s-1SUN III\s0-compatible version \(em
.IR netlink3 .\}
.SH EXAMPLES
Display the full status of the link to
.IR region ,
updating it every second:

You can increase the frequency with which the transport daemon
updates its status files by using the flag \fB\-U\fP,
see
.IR netdaemon (8).

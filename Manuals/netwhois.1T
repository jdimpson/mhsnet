     _N_e_t_w_h_o_i_s will obtain information about people from  publicly
     available data-bases on consenting hosts.

     The pattern supplied should be a regular expression suitable
     for  use by _e_g_r_e_p(1).  It will be used to match lines in the
     people data-base at the remote sites addressed  by  _a_d_d_r_e_s_s.
     The resulting output will be returned to you by mail.

     There is a (small) upper limit on the amount of  information
     that  may  be  returned  by  this command.  The limit can be
     expected to be around 2K bytes.

     _N_e_t_w_h_o_i_s's action may be modified by the following flags:

     ----qqqq  Report the request ID on _s_t_d_o_u_t and include  it  in  any
         response  that is returned.  This allows the matching of
         requests with responses.

     ----SSSS _s_e_n_d_e_r
         Change the name of  the  originator  to  _s_e_n_d_e_r.   (This
         option is restricted to network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r_s.)

     ----TTTT_n Activate tracing at level _n.  If tracing is not compiled
         in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     /usr/pub/whois
         This is the  default  data-base  for  information  about
         people.  It should consist of one line per person (lower
         case only,  unless  your  version  of  _e_g_r_e_p(1)  has  an
         `ignore  case'  flag),  with information such as mailing
         address (account name),  full  name,  telephone  number,
         etc.

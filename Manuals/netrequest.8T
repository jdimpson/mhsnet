     _N_e_t_r_e_q_u_e_s_t is used to broadcast local routing information to
     neighbouring  nodes, and to request routing information from
     other nodes.  It can be used to initiate the routing  tables
     at  network  installation  time,  or  to recover the routing
     tables  after  local  file-system  crashes.   Any  addresses
     mentioned  are  included  in  a  multicast  address  for the
     request, otherwise the request is sent to all active links.

     Requests are sent out with a one week timeout on them,  that
     is,  if they have not been delivered to their destination(s)
     within one week, the request is discarded.

     The optional flags are:

     ----aaaa  Request  all  network  topology  information  available,
         rather than a local sub-set in the routing tables.  (All
         information is _s_e_n_t if the flag ----eeee is  also  specified.)
         This   flag  is  ignored  with  broadcast  or  multicast
         addresses.

     ----bbbb  Broadcast the request to  all  sites  within  the  local
         region.

     ----eeee  Export the local  routing  information  along  with  the
         request.  If the address contains a broadcast, then only
         the local (node + links) routing details  are  exported,
         otherwise  information  about all regions in the routing
         tables is exported.

     ----iiii  Read an exportable routing file off _s_t_d_i_n to use instead
         of the default.  (Implies ----eeee.)

     ----llll  Include all active direct  links  in  the  request  (the
         default if no other addresses are specified).

     ----nnnn  Don't request - just  send  local  routing  information.
         (Implies ----eeee.)

     ----rrrr  Allow error returns from  remote  sites  (otherwise  the
         request will be discarded on error).

     ----tttt  Don't include a  timeout  with  the  message  (otherwise
         messages   expire   after   one  week).   This  flag  is
         ineffective if any address is a _b_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t.

     ----RRRR _r_e_g_i_o_n
         Restrict broadcasts to _r_e_g_i_o_n.

     ----SSSS _s_o_u_r_c_e
         Specify  a  source  address  for   non-default   routing
         information (must be the name of a link).

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----XXXX _f_i_l_e
         Use the exportable routing information in  _f_i_l_e  instead
         of the default.  (Implies ----eeee.)

     ----ZZZZ _t_i_m_e-_t_o-_d_i_e
         The message will be discarded on any route  which  takes
         more  than  _t_i_m_e-_t_o-_d_i_e  seconds  before  delivery.  The
         default for all broadcast messages is one week, but this
         option may be used to shorten the message life further.

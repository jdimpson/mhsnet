     _N_e_t_p_r_i_v_s contains network permissions for  people  accessing
     the   network.    Each   line  in  the  file  describes  the
     permissions to be allowed for a particular person, or for  a
     group.   The  contents  can  be  printed  selectively by the
     program _n_e_t_p_r_i_v_s(1).

     Lines start with a user or group name in  the  first  field,
     followed  immediately  by one colon (`::::') for a user, or two
     colons for a group, then a list of privileges  separated  by
     _s_p_a_c_e.   _S_p_a_c_e is any combination of <tab>, <space>, `,', or
     `;'.   Privileges  may  be  spread  over  several  lines  by
     preceding  the  continuation lines with _s_p_a_c_e.  Comments may
     be introduced with a hash (`####'),  and  continue  to  end-of-
     line.   Any  _s_p_a_c_e colon or hash character may be escaped by
     preceding it with a back-slash (`\\\\').

     An  asterisk  (`****')  in  the  first  field  allows   default
     privileges  to  be  set.   Subsequent  default  lists modify
     previous default lists.

     Named users inherit the current composite set  of  defaults.
     Group entries set defaults for all users who are a member of
     that group and have not  been  named  explicily  before  the
     group  name  occurs.   Any users not explicitly named in the
     file, and whose group is not named, will inherit  the  final
     composite of defaults.

     Each privilege listed is conferred  -  a  leading  plus-sign
     (`++++')  is ignored.  Alternatively a privilege may be removed
     by preceding it with either a minus-sign (`----'),  exclamation
     point  (`!!!!'),  or  tilde  (`~~~~').   Conferred  privileges are
     enabled first,  and  then  denied  privileges  are  removed,
     except  in  the  special  case of `----****' (see below), when all
     current privileges  are  turned  off,  before  enabling  the
     conferred ones.

     A  user's  privileges  consist  of  enabling  flags  and  an
     optional   address  restriction.   The  address  restriction
     prevents a user from sending messages  outside  the  regions
     named, and is introduced with an _a_t sign (`@@@@').

     The (case insensitive) flags are as follows:

     ****   All flags.

     Any program running under the uid NETUSERNAME  automatically
     gets all privileges.  If the invoker of a network program is
     the _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r or is a member of the group NETGROUPNAME then
     they   are   automatically   conferred  the  _S_U,  _B_r_o_a_d_c_a_s_t,

     If the file doesn't exist, or is empty, then users  get  the

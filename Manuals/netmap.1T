     _N_e_t_m_a_p prints the  network  state  information  and  routing
     tables.  Its default action will print out an alphabetically
     sorted list of all known regions in the state file, together
     with  their  links.   If  any  regions  are mentioned in the
     arguments, the list is  restricted  to  just  those  regions
     mentioned.  _R_e_g_i_o_n can be any name resolvable by the routing
     tables, or the special name `world' which matches the global
     region.   If  only  one region is named, and a state message
     has been received from it, then the details  will  be  taken
     from  the  state  message,  (unless  the  flags ----iiii or ----YYYY are
     specified).  Optional flags are:

     ----aaaa  Print all regions without restriction.

     ----bbbb  The region selection is extended to include all  regions
         contained in the ones mentioned.

     ----cccc  Check the CRC on the state  file.   Also,  terminate  on
         errors (otherwise warning messages are generated).

     ----dddd  Sort regions by distance if ----YYYY specified.

     ----ffff  Print the _f_o_r_c_e_d route list.

     ----iiii  Don't use an imported state message when printing region
         map.

     ----kkkk  Print the _a_l_i_a_s_e_s for all (selected) regions.

     ----llll  Don't show links when printing region map.

     ----mmmm  Print the address maps.

     ----rrrr  Print the routing tables.

     ----ssss  Print the region map.  If no other flags are  mentioned,
         this becomes the default action.

     ----tttt[e|i]
         Controls the printing of domain types.  The  default  is
         no  types,  but  this  flag  causes  either external (eeee)
         [default], or internal (iiii) types to be prepended to  all
         domain  names.  Unfortunately this means that any _r_e_g_i_o_n
         arguments must also have types (except  for  names  that
         can  be  fully  resolved  by  the  routing  tables,  see

     ----vvvv  Be more verbose when printing the region map.  This will
         cause  regions  without links to be included, as well as
         showing more details  for  each  region  and  link.   In
         particular, it will show any _c_o_m_m_e_n_t for the node owning
         the state message displayed.  This flag will  cause  the
         typed  region  names to be shown for the routing tables,
         and will also show more details for the address maps.

     ----wwww  Warn about inconsistencies.

     ----yyyy  Print link distances as times if ----YYYY selected.

     ----zzzz  The region selection becomes any  region  whose  _v_i_s_i_b_l_e
         region matches the ones mentioned.

     ----RRRR _r_o_u_t_e_f_i_l_e
         The route file name becomes _r_o_u_t_e_f_i_l_e.

     ----SSSS _s_t_a_t_e_f_i_l_e
         The state file name becomes _s_t_a_t_e_f_i_l_e.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----YYYY[All|Cheap|Fast]
         For each selected region, show the route from _h_o_m_e.  The
         nominal  _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e  for  each  link  in the route is also
         shown, in the form [[[[<_t_o_t_a_l>;;;;<_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e>]]]]....  Both _t_o_t_a_l and
         _d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e  will  be  ****  if  no real route is known.  Note
         also, that the effect of any current `route' command  is
         ignored  by  this option.  If _A_l_l is chosen, fast routes
         will be indicated by (_F), and cheap routes by (_C).  Only
         the  first character of the qualifier is necessary.  The
         default is _F_a_s_t.  `Fast' applies to the route  with  the
         minimum  `delay',  `cheap' applies to the route with the
         minimum `cost'.  These will be the same unless some link
         along  the  way  has  used  _n_e_t_s_t_a_t_e's `cost' command to
         change the default.  This option also prints  the  costs
         for   each   link  out  of  each  region,  in  the  form
         [[[[<_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e>]]]] (or [[[[<_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e>((((FFFF))))]]]] [[[[<_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e>((((CCCC))))]]]] if  _A_l_l

       netmap -rm

     Print the region map with verbose state descriptions for all
     locally   recognized   regions   in   the   domain   `Sydney
     University':

       netmap -bv 'Sydney University'

     The above example will only work  if  your  local  site  has
     _m_a_p_p_e_d  `Sydney  University'  to `ORG=su', so here is a more
     general example:

       netmap -bl PRMD=oz.COUNTRY=au

     This will give a terse listing  of  all  locally  recognized
     regions   in  the  private  management  domain  of  `oz'  in
     Australia (a.k.a. ACSnet).  You may  omit  the  `PRMD='  and
     `.COUNTRY=au'  if  `oz'  is  a  unique  domain  name in your
     routing tables.

     Show details for a particular site:

       netmap -v munnari.oz.au

     This will print details from the latest state  message  from
     `munnari'  if  one  has been received, otherwise it will use
     the default data-base.

     Show the route to the nearest region claiming global routing
     knowledge:

       netmap -Y world

     Show typed names for all  regions  claiming  global  routing
     knowledge:

     If the ----ssss (default) option is selected, _n_e_t_m_a_p prints out (a
     selected  portion of) the statefile as a list of regions and
     their links.  Links are printed on separate  lines  preceded
     by right arrows.

     If the ----vvvv (verbose) option  was  also  selected,  additional
     information  is provided.  First the region name is printed.

     Then the _v_i_s_i_b_l_e _r_e_g_i_o_n is  shown,  if  set.   This  is  the
     region  within  which  the named region propagates its state
     information, and within which it  is  capable  of  resolving
     addresses.   The  next  few  lines may contain flag settings
     such as HOME if the region contains _h_o_m_e, or FOREIGN if only
     non-MHSnet  state messages have been received from it.  Note
     that once a MHSnet state message has been  received  from  a
     node,   no   further   non-MHSnet  state  messages  will  be
     incorporated into the statefile.  Next the _c_o_m_m_e_n_t  data  is
     shown,  if  available.   The  next  line may show the date a
     state message was last received from the  node.   The  lines
     for the links will be followed by any _l_i_n_k flags, or routing
     parameters for the link.  (A link marked `(pseudo)' is for a
     region  whose existence is known by the region it is pseudo-
     linked to, but insufficient  routing  information  has  been
     received locally to determine a real route.)

     If the ----YYYY (show route) flag was selected, the last lines for
     each  region will show the route from _h_o_m_e, each preceded by
     the _w_e_i_g_h_t of the link and a left-arrow.

     The ----rrrr option prints out the routing table in two  sections.
     First  the local links are listed, together with information
     on any flags and programs associated with each link  if  the
     ----vvvv  option  is  also selected.  The next section is a sorted
     list of regions and shows, for each region, the link numbers
     for  the  fastest/cheapest  route, and, if the ----vvvv flag is in
     force, the links on  which  to  forward  broadcast  messages
     addressed  to  it.  This is in the form of a list of numbers
     that refer to the numbers printed for each link in the first
     section.   An  asterisk  printed  next to a _f_a_s_t link number
     implies that this is only one of  a  number  of  alternative
     equi-distant  routes.   An  asterisk printed next to a _c_h_e_a_p
     link number draws attention to the fact that it is different
     to the _f_a_s_t route.

     The ----mmmm option prints a number  of  address  mapping  tables.
     The  `Region  Forwarding Table' lists regions that are being
     _f_o_r_w_a_r_d_e_d to other regions.  The `Address Forwarding  Table'
     lists  addresses  that are being _f_o_r_w_a_r_d_e_d to other regions.
     The `Address Mapping Table' lists  the  value  of  addresses
     that are being _m_a_p_p_e_d into other regions (which includes the
     _a_l_i_a_s_e_s exported from other sites).  If the ----vvvv flag is  also
     selected,  the  `Ordered Types' are shown - most significant
     first, and the `Type Name Table' shows all  type  names  and
     their internal order.  The last table is the `Region Vector'
     which shows all known domains at the level of each domain in
     the local address.

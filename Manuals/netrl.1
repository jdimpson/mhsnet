.SH NAME
netrl \- fetch remote network queue details
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI \*(S6
.RB [\-[ q ]\c
.RB [ r | v ]]
.IR address " ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(S2
requests details of links at remote sites matched by
.IR address .
\*(S2
is a shell script that invokes
.IR netmsg (8)
to pass a request to the link interrogation message handler,
which invokes
.IR netlink (1)
to satisfy the request.
The results are returned as mail to the invoker.
.PP
The optional flags modify this behaviour:
.if n .ds tw 4
.if t .ds tw \w'\fB\-X\fPX'u
.TP "\*(tw"
.BI \-q
Requests the \s-1ID\s0 for the message,
which is written to
.IR stdout .
.TP
.BI \-r
Requests throughput rates instead of transfer totals when invoking netlink.
.TP
.BI \-v
Requests
.I verbose
mode when activating
.IR netlink .
.TP
.BI \-?
Explain argument options and exit.
.PP
Note that only network `super-users'
(as indicated by the flag
.SM SU
shown by
.IR netprivs (1))
will be able to use verbose mode,
which will cause the results to be returned to the special user `network'.
If this user doesn't have a normal mailbox,
then you should arrange for mail to be forwarded with
.IR netforward (1).
.PP
Requests generated by \*(S3 are served by the handler
.if n `llooker'.
.if t \f(CWllooker\fP.

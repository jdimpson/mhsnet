     netforward - set forwarding for network messages

     _N_e_t_f_o_r_w_a_r_d will list the invoker's  forwarding  actions  for
     each  message  type.  If any _a_d_d_r_e_s_s arguments are supplied,
     then the invoker's _f_i_l_e messages will be forwarded to  those
     addresses.  The format of _a_d_d_r_e_s_s is message-type dependent,
     but FTP addresses should be in the form:  _u_s_e_r_s@@@@_d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n_s
     (cf: _n_e_t_f_i_l_e(1)).

     Forwarding loops are detected by the network routing  layer,
     which will notify management for corrective action.

     Other possibilities are controlled by the following flags:

     ----aaaa  Show forwarding for all users and handlers.   This  flag
         is restricted to the network _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.

     ----cccc  Turn off forwarding for indicated message type.

     ----AAAA _h_a_n_d_l_e_r
         Affect forwarding for _h_a_n_d_l_e_r rather  than  the  default
         [_m_a_i_l_e_r].   You  may  use the common _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n for the
         handler as reported by _n_e_t_q(1), (eg: `mail'), instead of
         its  name.   This  flag  must  occur  before any address
         arguments.

     ----TTTT[_l_e_v_e_l]
         Turns on tracing at _l_e_v_e_l (default: 1).  If  tracing  is
         not compiled in, this flag will have no effect.

     ----UUUU _n_a_m_e
         Set/show the forwarding for _n_a_m_e, (which can be  a  user
         for  FTP  style  handlers,  or  the  name of the handler
         itself) rather than the  default  (the  invoker).   Note
         that _n_a_m_e is forced to lower-case, as matches are forced
         to lower case.  This flag is restricted to  the  network
         _s_u_p_e_r-_u_s_e_r.

     ----????  Explain argument options and exit.

     Set mail forwarding for invoker to `bob@mhs.oz.au':

       netforward bob@mhs.oz.au

       Note that this is more efficient than using  mail  program
       forwarding,    since   network   message   forwarding   is

       accomplished at the routing layer.

     Set file forwarding for `judy' to `cs.su.oz.au':

       netforward -A files -U judy judy@cs.su.oz.au

       See also _n_e_t_g_e_t's ----ffff flag.

     Set forwarding for `fileserver' requests to a  host  with  a
     public files data-base:

       netforward -Afileserver -Ufileserver plaza.aarnet.oz.au

     Set up a simple mailing-list:

       netforward -Umeeting helen,harry@xyz.oz.au \
            john,jane@cs.su.oz.au sophy,susan@mhs.oz.au

       Note that this is  far  more  efficient  than  using  mail
       program   distribution   lists,  as  these  nearly  always
       generate one message  for  each  recipient  in  the  list,
       whereas  the  above  will  generate  the minimum number of
       message copies needed to reach each recipient.

     All addresses are expanded to canonical form.

Chris has the same parameters as our default MHSnet sendmail.cf, and
they are much closer to what I'd have than that other entry.

There is some confusion about the $f and $g parameters. One is the
full address, and the other is the address "relative" to the sender.
For example, if the message was from muzza@elwood to piers@tmx, then
$f in the sendmail running on elwood would be muzza, and $g would be
muzza@elwood.

I don't like the $u@$h bit either, because it will try to deliver to
the recipient user on the local machine.

I have already sent a long reply to the guy.
